### Game Summary

The game **_Save: The Forest_** is a 2.5D Adventure game made in Unity. The story of the game starts with a forest that has been polluted due to the ongoing industrialisation and the _"Heart of The Forest"_ thereby has lost its vitality to support the thousands of lives residing in the forest. The player would need to control the warrior, Fox, to take on a journey of reviving the forest by crossing through obstacles, defeating enemies and finally collecting the elements including Wood, Water and Soil at the end of each level. 

###  How To Play The Game

The player can press keys `"A"` and `"D"` to move the character horizontally, `"SPACE"` to jump and `click` on the mouse to aim and shoot a stone. There exist enemies that cannot be killed, in which case the character needs to jump over them.

The player aims to collect all the stars at the end of each level to win the game. If the character is killed by obstacles or enemies, the current level will restart automatically. In each level, the pause menu can be triggered by pressing the key `"Esc"`, which provides options to go back to the main menu and quit the game. Finally, The player can only reach the next level by completing the current level, and the forest will only be saved after the fox has collected all the elements.
